# Intune Linux Custom Compliance Samples

This repository is for Linux Intune sample scripts and custom configuration profiles. There are many cases where it is necessary to use a custom profile or shell script to accomplish a task.


To make things a little easier to navigate the Linux repo has been split up into sections:


```
   |-Custom Compliance
   |-Misc
   |---Azure VM
   |---Enrollment Prep Script
```

### Disclaimer
Understand the impact of each sample script prior to running it; samples should be run in a non-production or "test" environment.
