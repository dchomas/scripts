## This script checks if MDE is installed, if MDE is licensed properly on a given device, and what version of MDE the device is running
## Given the variable intenstive nature of the script, there are no custom input variables. 
## The installation status, license status, and version are instead set via the script itself.

# Variables

# The first variable of interest is whether or not MDE is installed on the device. 
# If MDE is installed on the device (regardless of if it is licensed or not), the command "mdatp" will bring up the Microsoft Defender options menu
# If not, the script will not find the phrase "Microsoft Defender."

        INSTALLED=True

# If MDE is installed, the script then checks to see what its version is and if MDE is properly onboarded.
if [ "$INSTALLED" == "True" ]; then
    # This sets the licensed variable equal to MDE license status. 
    # If the device is properly onboarded, LICENSED!=false
    LICENSED=$(mdatp health --field licensed | grep "false")
    if ( "$LICENSED" != "false" ); then
        LICENSED=true
